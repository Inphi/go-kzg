# Verkle utils

Based on research implementation by @dankrad and @vbuterin here: https://github.com/ethereum/research/tree/master/verkle

This repo is *super experimental*.

This is an implementation in Go, initially aimed at chunkification and extension of data, 
and building proofs for the output data. 

Part of a low-latency data-availability sampling network prototype for Phase1.
